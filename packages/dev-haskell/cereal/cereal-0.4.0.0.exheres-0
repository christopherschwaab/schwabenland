SUMMARY="Binary serialization library"
DESCRIPTION="
A binary serialization library, similar to binary, that introduces an isolate primitive for parser
isolation, and replaces the asynchronous errors with a user-handleable Either type. Similar to
binary in performance, but uses a strict ByteString instead of a lazy ByteString, thus restricting
it to operating on finite inputs.
