SUMMARY="A multi-platform command-line programmer for Atmel chips with a USB bootloader supporting ISP."
DESCRIPTION="
A multi-platform command-line programmer for Atmel (8051, AVR, XMEGA & AVR32) chips with a USB
bootloader supporting ISP. Most Atmel devices having a USB port come pre-programmed with the
bootloader, and this is a lightweight alternative to Atmel's own FLIP/BatchISP program. This is a
mostly Device Firmware Update (DFU) 1.0 compliant user-space application.
